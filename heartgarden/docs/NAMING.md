# heartgarden naming vs repo paths

**Product and package name:** **heartgarden** (UI metadata, `package.json`, Vercel project name, marketing).

**App directory in git:** **`heartgarden/`** — the Next.js app root. All commands (`npm install`, `npm run check`, Vercel **Root Directory**) use this path.

## MCP tools

**Canonical tool names** are **`heartgarden_*`** (e.g. **`heartgarden_list_items`**, **`heartgarden_search`**), exposed by **`src/lib/mcp/heartgarden-mcp-server.ts`** and **`GET|POST|DELETE /api/mcp`**. **`vigil_*`** names are **legacy aliases**: the server still accepts them on **`tools/call`** and maps them to **`heartgarden_*`**.

## Stable technical identifiers (do not rename casually)

These stay as **`vigil…`** on purpose so existing data and integrations keep working:

- **TipTap / note links:** `vigil:item:<uuid>` (stored in `content_json` and Neon).
- **CSS design tokens:** `--vigil-*`, classes like `vigil-btn`, `data-vigil-theme` (large surface area).
- **localStorage keys:** e.g. `vigil-canvas-local-v1`, `vigil-recent-items-v2:<tier>`, `vigil-recent-folders-v2:<tier>`, `heartgarden-workspace-view-v2`, `vigil-canvas-effects-enabled`.

Renaming those requires migrations, dual-read/write, or user data loss.

Internal module/file names such as `VigilApp.tsx` or `vigil-ui-classes.ts` are legacy implementation detail; new code should prefer **heartgarden** in user-facing strings.

## Deploying

Step-by-step Vercel setup (root directory, env tables, Neon/R2, previews): **`docs/DEPLOY_VERCEL.md`**.

## If something breaks later

**Vercel build fails immediately** with *“The specified Root Directory `vigil` does not exist”* (or similar): the project still points at the old folder name. In **Vercel → Project → Settings → General → Root Directory**, set **`heartgarden`**, save, then **Redeploy**. Environment variables stay on the project; only the subfolder for install/build changes.

**Stale `vigil/` folder on disk (Windows):** The repo app path is **`heartgarden/`**. If a leftover **`vigil`** directory exists at the monorepo root (e.g. locks during a rename), it may be listed in the **root** `.gitignore` as **`/vigil/`**. Close editors/dev servers using it, then delete the folder manually if you want it gone.

**`package-lock.json` looks different after `npm install` on Windows:** Optional Linux-only entries can differ from CI. Before pushing lockfile changes, run **`npm run verify:package-lock-ci`** from **`heartgarden/`** (see **`AGENTS.md`**).
